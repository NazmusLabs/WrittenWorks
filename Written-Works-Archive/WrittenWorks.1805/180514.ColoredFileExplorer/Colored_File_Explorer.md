File Explorer Adapts to Accent Color in Windows 10 RS5 Insider Preview

With the latest Insier Preview build for Windows 10's next major feature update, we appear to be getting a more colorful File Explorer.

While Microsoft's Dona Sarkar highlighted the introduction of the dark theme in File Explorer in the announcement of Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17666, I have since discovered an additional treasure after having played around with the new build. And that treasure is that File Explorer now adapts to your chosen accent color for Windows 10.

As you may know, Windows 10 allows you to choose a background theme along with an accent color as part of the operating system's color personalization. You could pick from a dark or light theme for the background and from a preset of colors for the accent color. And recently, with the avilability of the Creators Update, you can even define a custom accent color.

Until now, Windows's File Explorer did not honor your choise of the colors. It always used a light theme and sported shades of blue for its accent color.

With Build 17666, not only File Explorer now displayes in both light and dark theme based on user choice, parts of File Explorer's ribbon toolbar will be shaded with varrying degree of the chosen accent color.

What's more interesting is that with the light theme set, higher saturated accent colors shades the majority of the ribbon toolbar while less saturated accent colors only colors fewer portions of the ribbon, nameley the File Button and hover highlights.

What's important to note that because this is featured in an Insider Preview build, it may be that all this is just user interface experimentation and based on user feedback and real world testing, the accent color shading might be changed significantly or be dropped altogether.

Also remember that Microsoft themselves said that the dark themed File Explorer in build 17666 is already very much behind their latest internally compiled build. So, it may be safe to assume that we might get a better representation of the accent coloring in the next insider preview build. And I am eager to test it out.

SATURATED FILE EXPLORER

In my opinion, I very much like the idea of the accent color in File Explorer. However, like the incomplete dark theme in this build, the feature looks severely unfinished and the colors unoptimized. For instance, the mouse-hover shading for liter accent colors are blends too much with the background and saturated accent colors covering most of the ribbon is, frankly, unpleasent to look at.
